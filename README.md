# FitPredict ðŸ’ª
This is our repository for Group 88's CSC207 Final Project.
This project allows users to make fitness predictions based on their current, daily fitness stats.
Below, we will include a description of how to run and use it.

## How To Run & Open
You will first need to download the `main` branch of this repository. 
After it is downloaded, open `src/main/java/Main.java`.
This is the main file of the project, where the UI screen can be run from. 
After opening this file, right-click on any part of the code and click `Run 'Main.main()'`, as shown in the picture:

![image](images/1run_main.png)

This will run the program. The program screen should pop up and prompt you to enter login information or create a new account. 

If the program does not compile, you may need to change the runner. 
To do this, go to the IntelliJ `Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven > Gradle` or `Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven > Gradle`.
In the `Build and run section`, select `IntelliJ IDEA` for both `Build and run using` and `Run tests using`.
This should fix things.
Now, re-run the program!

## How To Use
Next, we will go over how to use the program's features. 
After running `Main.main()` in `src/main/java/Main.java`, the Login & Create Account screen will pop up:
